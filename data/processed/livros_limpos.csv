Advanced Data Engineering with AWS: Building Scalable and Reliable Data Pipelines 2025,"AUTHOR :1- GAYATRI TAVVA, AUTHOR :2 - DR PRIYANKA KAUSHIK",Computers,0,0,170,,"PREFACE The exponential growth of data has redefined the way organizations operate, compete, and innovate. In today’s digital era, businesses are no longer just consumers of data but active participants in building complex, scalable ecosystems that collect, process, store, and derive value from massive data streams. Amazon Web Services (AWS), as the world’s leading cloud platform, offers a robust suite of tools and services that empower enterprises to transform raw data into actionable insights with unprecedented speed and reliability. This book, Advanced Data Engineering on AWS: Building Scalable, Secure, and Intelligent Pipelines, is designed to guide readers through the essential foundations and evolving innovations in data engineering using AWS. It systematically covers the principles and practices needed to architect high-performance data pipelines that can handle modern business demands. The journey begins with establishing the Foundations of Data Engineering in the AWS Ecosystem, helping readers understand how AWS services interplay to create a seamless environment for data management. We then explore Designing Data Pipelines for Scalability and Reliability, focusing on the architectural patterns that ensure resilience and flexibility in an unpredictable data landscape. As data sources become increasingly diverse and dynamic, mastering Data Ingestion Techniques on AWS is critical. We delve into both batch and real-time ingestion strategies, enabling efficient collection of high-velocity data. Coupled with this is Data Storage Optimization using services like S3, Redshift, and Beyond, ensuring that storage solutions align with both performance and cost-efficiency goals. Understanding ETL and ELT on AWS is pivotal for preparing data for downstream analytics and machine learning tasks. Subsequently, Real-Time Data Processing on AWS highlights how to transform and analyze data streams to deliver timely, business-critical insights. Automation becomes key as we address Data Orchestration and Workflow Automation, enabling complex pipelines to run with minimal human intervention. Ensuring trust in data requires rigorous focus on Data Quality and Governance, laying a strong foundation for secure, compliant, and high-fidelity analytics. We further extend this security narrative in Security and Compliance in AWS Data Pipelines, offering a deep dive into encryption, access controls, and regulatory alignment. No modern pipeline is complete without observability; hence, Monitoring, Logging, and Performance Tuning explores techniques to gain actionable insights into pipeline behavior, prevent failures, and optimize operations proactively. In an increasingly globalized world, Advanced Architectures: Multi-Region and Hybrid Pipelines prepares readers for designing architectures that span geographic—es and cloud environments, ensuring data availability and fault tolerance. Finally, we look ahead to Future Trends: AI/ML-Driven Data Engineering on AWS, where artificial intelligence automates data engineering tasks, adaptive pipelines become reality, and next-generation solutions redefine how businesses leverage data at scale. This book aims to serve data engineers, architects, cloud practitioners, and technical leaders who seek to not only build scalable AWS-based systems but also future-proof their architectures in an evolving technology landscape. Through a blend of foundational principles, hands-on techniques, best practices, and forward-looking insights, this book is your comprehensive guide to mastering advanced data engineering on AWS. We invite you to embark on this journey to build the data systems that will power the intelligent enterprises of tomorrow. Authors Gayatri Tavva Dr Priyanka Kaushik",0.0,BRL,True,,short

Data Engineering,Gerard Blokdyk,Outros,0,0,120,2017-10-14,"Defining, designing, creating, and implementing a process to solve a business challenge or meet a business objective is the most valuable role... In EVERY company, organization and department. Unless you are talking a one-time, single-use project within a business, there should be a process. Whether that process is managed and implemented by humans, AI, or a combination of the two, it needs to be designed by someone with a complex enough perspective to ask the right questions. Someone capable of asking the right questions and step back and say, 'What are we really trying to accomplish here? And is there a different way to look at it?' For more than twenty years, The Art of Service's Self-Assessments empower people who can do just that - whether their title is marketer, entrepreneur, manager, salesperson, consultant, business process manager, executive assistant, IT Manager, CxO etc... - they are the people who rule the future. They are people who watch the process as it happens, and ask the right questions to make the process work better. This book is for managers, advisors, consultants, specialists, professionals and anyone interested in Data Engineering assessment. All the tools you need to an in-depth Data Engineering Self-Assessment. Featuring 618 new and updated case-based questions, organized into seven core areas of process design, this Self-Assessment will help you identify areas in which Data Engineering improvements can be made. In using the questions you will be better able to: - diagnose Data Engineering projects, initiatives, organizations, businesses and processes using accepted diagnostic standards and practices - implement evidence-based best practice strategies aligned with overall goals - integrate recent advances in Data Engineering and process design strategies into practice according to best practice guidelines Using a Self-Assessment tool known as the Data Engineering Scorecard, you will develop a clear picture of which Data Engineering areas need attention. Included with your purchase of the book is the Data Engineering Self-Assessment downloadable resource, which contains all questions and Self-Assessment areas of this book in a ready to use Excel dashboard, including the self-assessment, graphic insights, and project planning automation - all with examples to get you started with the assessment right away.
