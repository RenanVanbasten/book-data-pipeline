Must Read: Rediscovering American Bestsellers,Sarah Churchwell,Literary Criticism,0.0,0,284,2012-08-02,"What is it about certain books that makes them bestsellers? Why do some of these books remain popular for centuries, and others fade gently into obscurity? And why is it that when scholars do turn their attention to bestsellers, they seem only to be interested in the same handful of blockbusters, when so many books that were once immensely popular remain under-examined? Addressing those and other equally pressing questions about popular literature, Must Read is the first scholarly collection to offer both a survey of the evolution of American bestsellers as well as critical readings of some of the key texts that have shaped the American imagination since the nation's founding. Focusing on a mix of enduring and forgotten bestsellers, the essays in this collection consider 18th and 19th century works, like Charlotte Temple or Ben-Hur, that were once considered epochal but are now virtually ignored; 20th century favorites such as The Sheik and Peyton Place; and 21st century blockbusters including the novels of Nicholas Sparks, The Kite Runner, and The Da Vinci Code.",229.63,BRL,True,2012,medium

Em Busca de Heróis (Livro #1 O Anel Do Feiticeiro),Morgan Rice,Juvenile Fiction,5.0,1,407,2014-05-19,"“O ANEL DO FEITICEIRO reúne todos os ingredientes para um sucesso instantâneo: tramas, intrigas, mistério, bravos cavaleiros e florescentes relacionamentos repletos de corações partidos, decepções e traições. O livro manterá o leitor entretido por horas e agradará a pessoas de todas as idades. Recomendado para fazer parte da biblioteca permanente de todos os leitores do gênero de fantasia.” --Books and Movie Reviews, Roberto Mattos O Best-seller #1! Da Autora de Best-sellers #1 — Morgan Rice — chega a estréia de uma nova série de fantasia deslumbrante. EM BUSCA DE HERÓIS (LIVRO #1 O ANEL DO FEITICEIRO) o qual gira em torno da épica história de amadurecimento de um garoto especial, um jovem de quatorze anos, de uma pequena vila nos arredores do Reino do Anel. Sendo o mais jovem de quatro filhos, o menos favorito de seu pai e odiado por seus irmãos, Thor sente que ele é diferente dos demais. Ele sonha com se tornar um grande guerreiro, unir-se aos homens do Rei e proteger o Anel das hordas de criaturas que vivem do outro lado do Canyon. Quando ele atinge a idade para tentar alistar-se na Legião do Rei e é proibido por seu pai de fazê-lo, Thor se recusa a aceitar a um não como resposta: ele empreende sua própria jornada solitária, determinado a abrir o seu caminho para a Corte do Rei e ser levado a sério. Mas a corte do rei está repleta de seus próprios dramas familiares, lutas de poder, ambições, ciúmes, violência e traição. O Rei MacGil deve escolher um herdeiro entre os seus filhos e a antiga Espada do Destino, a fonte de todo o seu poder, permanece ainda intocada, aguardando a chegada do escolhido. Thorgrin chega como um forasteiro e luta para ser aceito e se juntar à Legião do Rei. Thorgrin começa a perceber que ele tem poderes misteriosos os quais ele não entende bem; que ele tem um dom especial e um destino especial. Contra todas as probabilidades, ele se apaixona pela filha do rei e seu relacionamento proibido floresce; ele também descobre que possui rivais poderosos. Enquanto Thor luta para compreender o significado de seus poderes, o feiticeiro do rei o acolhe sob sua asa protetora e conta-lhe sobre a mãe que ele nunca conheceu, de uma terra longínqua, além do Canyon, além até mesmo da Terra dos Dragões. Antes que Thorgrin possa aventurar-se e se tornar o guerreiro que ele tanto anseia ser, ele deve completar seu treinamento. Mas talvez isso possa ser abreviado, já que Thor se encontra no centro das tramas e intrigas reais, as quais podem ameaçar seu amor e derrubá-lo — juntamente com o Reino inteiro. Com sua ambientação em um mundo sofisticado e sua caracterização de época, EM BUSCA DE HERÓIS é um conto épico sobre amigos e amantes, rivais e pretendentes, sobre cavaleiros e dragões, intrigas e maquinações políticas, sobre atingir a maioridade, corações partidos, mentira, ambição, e traição. É uma história de honra e coragem, de destinos, de feitiçaria. É uma fantasia que nos leva a um mundo que nunca esqueceremos e que vai interessar a todas as idades e gêneros. Contém 82.000 palavras. 3 livros, de um total de 13 da série, já estão disponíveis! “Captou a minha atenção desde o início e eu não pude soltá-lo... Esta é uma história de aventura incrível que combina agilidade e ação desde o início. Você não encontrará nela nenhum momento maçante.” --Paranormal Romance Guild {referindo-se a Transformada} “Uma fantasia mística que tece elementos de mistério e intriga ao longo de sua história. EM BUSCA DE HERÓIS trata-se de armar-se de coragem e de viver uma vida com propósito, a qual conduz ao crescimento, maturidade e excelência.… Para aqueles que procuram aventuras de fantasia substanciais: os protagonistas, a trama, e a ação fornecem um vigoroso conjunto de situações que se concentram na evolução de Thor; quem deixará de ser um garoto sonhador, para ser um jovem adulto e enfrentar situações nas quais a sobrevivência seria improvável... É apenas o começo do que promete ser uma série épica para adultos jovens.” --Midwest Book Review (D. Donovan, eBook Reviewer)",0.0,BRL,True,2014,long

Um passo de sorte,Jojo Moyes,Fiction,0.0,0,425,2023-06-28,"Em novo best-seller, Jojo Moyes traz a história de duas mulheres bem diferentes que acabam cruzando caminhos por causa de um sapato. Livro é inspirado em conto da autora. Sam não diria que está no melhor momento da sua vida, mas é grata pelo que tem, como seu emprego — que parece estar por um fio — e sua família, ainda que praticamente carregue todos nas costas. Ela sabe que basta um dia ruim para que tudo vá pelos ares — só espera muito que esse dia não seja aquele com reuniões tão importantes pela frente... Nisha tem tudo com que sempre sonhou, e muito mais: um casamento com um homem incrivelmente rico, viagens internacionais, roupas de marca... Mas, agora que seu marido quer se divorciar, está prestes a perder tudo isso. Os caminhos de Sam e Nisha, duas mulheres completamente diferentes, nunca deveriam ter se cruzado, mas esse encontro vai mudar a vida de ambas para sempre. E o motivo não poderia ser mais estranho: um par de sapatos Louboutin. Fãs de Jojo Moyes podem identificar certa semelhança com um conto da autora: o livro é inspirado em “Sapatos de pele de crocodilo”, narrativa curta que integra Paris para um e outros contos, lançado pela Intrínseca em 2017. Com uma história dinâmica e cheia de reviravoltas, Um passo de sorte traz não apenas uma Jojo Moyes mais divertida do que nunca, como também um enredo emocionante sobre como as amizades — por mais improváveis que sejam — podem fazer toda a diferença na nossa vida.",46.9,BRL,True,2023,long

Archer and Jockers just may have done so.""—Sylvia Day, New York Times bestselling author Ask most people about massive success in the world of fiction, and you’ll typically hear that it’s a game of hazy crystal balls. The sales figures of E. L. James or Dan Brown seem to be freakish—random occurrences in an unknowable market. But what if there were an algorithm that could reveal a secret DNA of bestsellers, regardless of their genre? What if it knew, just from analyzing the words alone, not just why genre writers like John Grisham and Danielle Steel belong on the lists, but also that authors such as Junot Diaz, Jodi Picoult, and Donna Tartt had telltale signs of success all over their pages? Thanks to Jodie Archer and Matthew Jockers, the algorithm exists, the code has been cracked, and the results bring fresh new insights into how fiction works and why we read. The Bestseller Code offers a new theory for why Fifty Shades of Grey sold so well. It sheds light on the current craze for dark heroines. It reveals which themes tend to sell best. And all with fascinating supporting data taken from a five-year study of twenty thousand novels. Then there is the hunt for ""the one""—the paradigmatic example of bestselling writing according to a computer's analysis of thousands of points of data. The result is surprising, a bit ironic, and delightfully unorthodox. This book explains groundbreaking text-mining research in accessible terms and offers a new perspective on the New York Times bestseller list. It's a big-idea book about the relationship between creativity and technology that will be provocative to anyone interested in how analytics have already transformed the worlds of finance, medicine, and sports. But at heart it is a celebration of books for readers and writers—a compelling investigation into how successful writing works, and a fresh take on our intellectual and emotional response to stories.",54.23,BRL,True,2016,medium

Hype,Jon Helgason,Literary Criticism,0.0,0,254,2015-01-01,"In the world of books and literature, “hype” is associated with bestsellerism - the books that sell the most, are read by vast numbers, and constantly talked about in media and staff rooms. Often, it is the success in itself that generates an interest because popularity begets popularity. Quite often though, a hyped bestseller is met with a skeptic criticism of poor language, a badly constructed plot, a predictable story line, or all three. The bestseller phenomenon is sometimes conceived as a threat against “real” literature. Research into the creation, reception, and meaning of bestsellers is utterly scarce and Hype: Bestsellers and Literary Culture is an important contribution to the understanding of the literature read by the masses. Popular literature plays an important role in the lives of millions of readers, offering entertainment, social commentary, and alternate perspectives on everyday life. This volume brings together such diverse issues as the creation of hype, the role and the meaning of the author in the present-day media landscape, changes in the book trade, and the relationship between bestsellers and research into them. Further articles give an historical overview on postapocalyptic stories, desert romances and the role of the authors. This book offers new knowledge on a subject that is increasingly popular within university curricula. Although the anthology is a work of academic research the texts are of equal interest to general readers.",74.88,BRL,True,2015,medium

Tante,Anne Douglas Sedgwick,Fiction,0.0,0,443,2015-06-25,"Excerpt from Tante Illuminated by chill gas-jets, armed with books and sandwiches, the serried and devoted ranks were composed of typical concert-goers, of types, in some cases, becoming as extinct as the muffin-man; young art-students from the suburbs, dressed in Liberty serges and velveteens, and reading ninepenny editions of Browning and Rossetti - though a few, already, were reading Yeats; middle-aged spinsters from Bayswater or South Kensington, who took their weekly concert as they took their daily bath; many earnest young men, soft-hatted and long-haired, studying scores; the usual contingent of the fashionable and economical lady; and the pale-faced business man, bringing an air of duty to the pursuit of pleasure. Some time before the doors opened a growing urgency began to make itself felt. People got up from their insecurely balanced camp-stools or rose stiffly from the stone steps to turn and stand shoulder to shoulder, subtly transformed from comrades in discomfort to combatants for a hazardous reward. The field for personal endeavour was small; the stairs were narrow and their occupants packed like sardines; yet everybody hoped to get a better seat than their positions entitled them to hope for. Hope and fear increased in intensity with the distance from the doors, those mute, mystic doors behind which had not yet been heard a chink or a shuffle and against which leaned, now balefully visible, the earliest comers of all, jaded, pallid, but insufferably assured. The summons came at length in the sound of drawn bolts and chains and a peremptory official voice, blood-tingling as a trumpet-call; and the crowd, shoulder to shoulder and foot to foot, with rigid lips and eyes uplifted, began to mount like one man. Step by step they went, steady and wary, each pressing upon those who went before and presenting a resistant back to those who followed after. The close, emulous contacts bred stealthy strifes and hatreds. A small lady, with short grey hair and thin red face and the conscienceless, smiling eye of a hypnotized creature, drove her way along the wall and mounted with the agility of a lizard to a place several steps above.
